# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 
 This project is similar to another project that I have previously done. Only this time bootstrap was added to the project making it easier to be developed. It was good practice and I have improved my bootstrap skills during this project. In my opinion Bootstrap it`s very good tool when it comes to layouts.It made me focus more on what to do instead on how to do.
